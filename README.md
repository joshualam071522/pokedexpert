Designed by Team Rocket (Joshua Lam, Riku Choy, Jason Rich, and Joel Quezada), the Pok√©-Dexpert is a fully functioning website designed to replicate the functions of a Pok√©-Dex from the world famous anime Pok√©mon. The user can type in any pokemon of their choosing in order to see it's in-game sprite, combat stats, and general trivia from Bulbapedia.

## Description

For this project, our group created an app that lets you search for basic information for a pok√©mon. The motivation for this app was to allow for pok√©mon enthusiasts to easily find basic stats and some information about any pok√©mon without having to google and load up multiple wikipedia articles if you want to look up multiple pok√©mon. The app uses two API, mainly the mediawiki API for Bulbapedia and the pokeAPI.

## Installation

Installation of the app mainly involved deploying the application using GitHub Pages.


## Usage

Pok√©-Dexpert is relatively easy to use. There is a search bar, where you type in the name of the pok√©mon you want to look up. After typing in the name of the pok√©mon, press on the big red button name that says 'Search'. If you leave the search bar blank when you press the search button, it will return an error saying that you need to type in the name of the pok√©mon. If you accidently misspelled a pokemon's name, it will return an error telling you to make sure you typed in the name correctly. After you successfully complete type in the name of the pok√©mon and search, you will notice the three boxes with the sleeping snorlax to update into a sprite image, the basic stats and element type, and some trivia facts about that pok√©mon. You will also notice that there is a section called Recent Searches. For every successful pok√©mon you search, it will add that name to the Recent Searches section, so you do not have to type in that pok√©mon you searched before!. It can store up to 5 of your last searches. Pressing on any of those recent searches will load up that pok√©mon! One thing to notice, is that it might take a little bit longer for the trivia section to update to the pok√©mon you searched for, so if you see trivia facts for charmander when you are looking at Pikachu, Don't worry! You just need to wait a few more seconds.
